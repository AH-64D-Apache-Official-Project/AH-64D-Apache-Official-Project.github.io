This page will explain the difference of the Apache provided by this mod and Apaches provided by RHS/CUP and DCS.

## Differences
1. Better than the DCS and RHS/CUP choppers. The flight model is more in line with the actual chopper and also the weapons work better.
2. DCS has the AH-64D BLK II which has a digital screen (TEDAC) for the TADS while this mod is a version behind, The AH-64D, the TADS is seen through an eyepiece at least in the game.
3. There is DVO (Colour), DTV (Black and White) and FLIR (Thermal with in-built A3TI). There is no night vision in the TADS.
4. Clicky-clicky, and buttons. Both exist, allowing for players to either interact with the mouse or use MPDs to interact with the screens.
5. Did we mention a better flight model, well here it is again. A better flight model and simulation.
6. Integrates with ACE for missile guidance and CBA for addon options to allow for some customisation of the helicopter.
7. Uses the new mod keybinds from Arma 3 for interfacing with joysticks and other external peripherals.
8. NO STINGERS ON THE EXTERNAL HARDPOINTS. ASK THE INFANTRY TO CLEAR THE SKY OR USE YOUR CANNON OR LASER GUIDED HELLFIRE.
9. The pixelation of the TADS image is a feature of the mod and a representation of the actual real life TADS of the modelled version of the Apache.

Points 1 and 5 are important, the chopper will be heavy when carrying a full load of munitions and fuel. Scarifice something to get it flying.

## History
This mod has a long history and was initially created in Arma II by Franze and Nodunit. Initially released 12 years ago, it was the first aircraft of its kind in the Arma community and was subsequently ported to Arma 3 by Franze and Nodunit in 2017. It has been on a long journey of open-source development by a lot of dedicated modders to bring this mod to where it is today.

This mod has inspired a lot of similar mods to be developed along the way, and you may be familiar with them (F/A-18 Super Hornet, H-60, A-10s), with more people continuing to work and add more aircraft like ours to Arma’s collection.

The most notable of these would be the Hatchet H-60 due to its increasing popularity in large milsim units. This is because of its nature as a troop transport, high-resolution model, and its ability to equip pylon weapons, giving people a lot of flexibility.

## Getting started
Those with prior experience with familiar mods will have a great jumping-off point into utilizing this mod. It has a lot of in-depth and complicated systems for you to learn and utilize; however, many of them are not necessary for basic operation of the aircraft, allowing you to start using the aircraft quickly and learn along the way. The newest update has had a lot of work put into making the mod more robust and harder for people to break.

One of the biggest differences is the Flight Model, which is completely custom-coded. It has moved us away from Arma’s flight models and allowed us to create a flight model for the Apache which is evan better than what you will find in DCS.
