* GREEN = ADVISORIES = Letting you know that something needs your attention eventually.

## Warnings:
* Engine 1 Fire, Engine 2 Fire, APU Fire, Aft Deck Fire
    * These warnings tell you where the aircraft is on fire, use the fire panel to extinguish the flames!

* Engine 1 Out, Engine 2 Out
    * One or both of the engines have been destroyed. Repair them to get them working again.

* High Rotor RPM, Low Rotor RPM
    * High rotor RPM means there is to much airflow over the blades and they are spinning faster than 106%. Low rotor RPM means you are pulling to much torque and rotor speed has fallen below 95%. 

* Hydraulics Failure, Tail Rotor Hydraulics Failure
    * Hydraulics systems reservoirs had completely drained and have completely failed. Use the emergency hydraulics switch to give yourself 30 more seconds of control.

    * Forward fuel low is > 5% fuel.

* APU On
    * APU is on while in flight.

* Auto/Manual Stabilator Fail
    * Stabilator has taken to much damage and has failed.

* Primary Hydraulics Pressure Low, Secondary Hydraulics Preassure Low

* Primary Hydraulics Level Low, Secondary Hydraulics Level Low
    * Primary and/or secondary hydraulics level has fallen below 10%.

* BUCS Fail
    * Back Up Control System, hydraulics system has taken to much damage causing the FMC to fail.
