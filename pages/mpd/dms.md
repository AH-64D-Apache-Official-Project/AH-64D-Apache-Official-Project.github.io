## Introduction
This page is used for loading waypoints, targets areas and other logic entities from the Eden editor. Each Apache in the mission will load the same waypoints and control points which are specified in the Eden editor.

These logic entities can be loaded into the chopper using the `Master Load` Button. This will automatically pull the location of the logic entities and populate them in the TSD for the helicopter the player is in.

Check => Will they transfer with the player or remain with the helicopter.
