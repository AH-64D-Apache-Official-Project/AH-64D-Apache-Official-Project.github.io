**Up-Front Display (UFD)** - The UFD provides the crews with active Warnings (W), Cautions (C) and Advisories (A) as well as currently selected frequencies. In the bottom left corner of the UFD is the current fuel amount in pounds. The bottom right corner provides the crew with a clock.

**WCA section**

## Warnings:
* Engine 1 Fire, Engine 2 Fire, APU Fire, Aft Deck Fire
    * These warnings tell you where the aircraft is on fire, use the fire panel to extinguish the flames!

* Engine 1 Overspeed, Engine 2 Overspeed
    * Engine Np is >= 115%.

* Engine 1 Out, Engine 2 Out
    * One or both of the engines have been destroyed. Repair them to get them working again.

* High Rotor RPM, Low Rotor RPM
    * High rotor RPM means there is to much airflow over the blades and they are spinning faster than 106%. Low rotor RPM means you are pulling to much torque and rotor speed has fallen below 95%. 

* Hydraulics Failure, Tail Rotor Hydraulics Failure
    * Hydraulics systems reservoirs had completely drained and have completely failed. Use the Emergency hydraulics switch to give yourself 30 more seconds of control.

## Cautions:
* Generator 1 Fail, Generator 2 Fail
* Rectifier 1 Fail, Rectifier 2 Fail
* Gearbox Vibration
* Gearbox 1 Chips, Gearbox 2 Chips
* Main Transmission Chips
* Forward Fuel Low, Aft Fuel Low
* APU On
* Auto/Manual Stabilator Fail
* Primary Hydraulics Pressure Low, Secondary Hydraulics Preassure Low
* Primary Hydraulics Level Low, Secondary Hydraulics Level Low
* BUCS Fail
* Infrared Jammer Fail 

## Advisories:
* Canopy Open
* Battery
* APU Start, APU Power On, APU On, APU Stop
* Engine 1 Starting
* Engine 2 Starting
* Attitude Hold (Auto-Hover turned on)
* Hover Drift
* Radar Altitude Hold, Barometric Altitude Hold
* Rotor Break On 
* FCR Fault
* Tail Wheel Lock Selected
* Approching Waypoint, Passed Waypoint
