_ADD IMAGE HERE FOR ATK MODE OF TSD_

_ADD IMAGE HERE FOR NAV MODE OF TSD_
## Introduction

The TSD, or tactical situation display, is one of the pages you will find yourself heavily using. It is where any waypoints, control measures and target points made or imported via the logic entities will be displayed, along with where all your targeting information generated by the FCR is stored.

It can be in one of two modes, either ATK or NAV. In ATK, it is going to show you targeting information while in NAV it is going to show you waypoints.

{% include important.html content="In reality in the real aircraft the distinction between the two modes is less defined, you can see most things in both situations. The information displayed can be changed via the SHOW push button." %}

There are the following limitations for the control measures, waypoints and target points : 
1. 49 Control Measures
2. 50 Waypoints
3. 50 Target Points

{% include important.html content="In NAV mode/phase the top 16 targets are shown. In the ATK mode/phase 128 FCR targets can be displayed." %}


## Info

The two sub-pages for the TSD can be changed using the `PHASE` button. For configuring the display, the `SHOW` button can be used to change the information displayed on either mode screen. The two modes are explained in detail below with the different options for displaying information in each mode.

### NAV mode

1. Current bearing of the helicopter.
2. Current scale level of the map.
3. The waypoint information -> Waypoint name, distance to waypoint, time taken to reach waypoint and ground speed of the helicopter.
4. Atomspheric conditions
5. ENDR -> Endurance of the helicopter in hours and minutes, HH:MM.
6. RWLR threats
7. Planned target/threat -> By default not shown in the NAV mode.
8. Control measures loaded in the helicopter or created by the player.
9. Friendly and enemy units -> Not shown by default in the NAV mode.
10. Targets detected by the FCR.

### ATK mode

0. Current bearing of the helicopter.
1. Planned target/threat -> Targets loaded via the logic entities. Shown by default in the helicopter.
2. Current route -> Not shown by default in the helicopter.
3. Friendly Units
4. Enemy Units -> Not shown by default in the ATK mode.
5. RWLR threats
6. ENDR -> Endurance of the helicopter in hours and minutes, HH:MM.
7. WIND -> Atmospheric conditions
8. Hazards -> Displays any hazards to flight operations. Can be loaded via DTU page or created by players in NAV mode.
9. SHOT -> 
10. Control measures loaded in the helicopter or created by the player.
11. Targets detected by the FCR.

### Target types

Here is a table of all types of targets, how they will look in different situations and their name as a type.

## Operations

### Common operations

#### Zooming in and out

1. The scale changes the zoom of the TSD, click on the `SC` (Scale) button will show 4 options, 5, 10, 25, 50. This will show either 5km ahead of the players current position or anything within a 5km radius if the players helicopter is centered to the middle of the screen.

#### Centering Map

There are two options for the centreing of the player's helicopter which can be changed by pressing the `CTR` button below the `SC` button. There are two modes, the players helicopter is in the centre of the TSD page. The second option is that the player's helicopter is centered towards the bottom edge of the TSD page.

#### Switching modes (ATK/NAV)

1. Press the PHASE button on the TSD page to switch between NAV and ATK modes.

#### Toggling map
There is no map present in the TSD, it will only show a blank screen.

## NAV operations

In the NAV mode, the player can either edit a waypoint, add a waypoint, delete a waypoint or store the current position of the helicopter as a waypoint. All this can be done via clicking on the `WPT` button on the TSD page. That will show 4 options, ADD, DEL, EDT and STO. The different operations are explained in detail below.

Target Points cannot be created in the NAV mode of the TSD.

### Adding a waypoint (ADD)

1. The player has to selet the type of identification group for the waypoint. There are 3 choices, 
    1. WP
    2. HZ
    3. CM

To enter the details of the waypoint the player will need to use the KU. To start using the KU, the player will need to press the `IDENT` button. There are 4 text fields which will be present on the KU for population by the player.
1. IDENT : Identification or Type of waypoint depending upon the IDENT group selected on the TSD page. The possible IDENTS are defined [here](./mpd-dms).
2. FREE : Maximum of 3 letters for the waypoint. Used to describe the waypoint. Advised not to leave blank.
3. GRID : 8 digit grid reference for the waypoint
4. ALTITUDE : Height of the waypoint above MSL.

### Edit a waypoint (EDT)

This sub-mode is similar to the ADD submode, the main difference being the player has to select the waypoint to edit first and then change either the free text, grid reference or height above MSL.

1. Click on the POINT button for the KU to reflece POINT. Via the KU change the POINT value to the Waypoint IDENT which needs to be changed.
2. Then click on EDT for the following KU inputs from the player.
    1. FREE : Maximum of 3 letters for the waypoint. Used to describe the waypoint. Advised not to leave blank.
    2. GRID : Displays the current grid reference for the waypoint, can be changed or left as is.
    3. ALTITUDE : Displays the current height above MSL for the waypoint, can be changed or left as is.

### Deleting a waypoint (DEL)

This a simple submode which deletes a selected waypoint. The waypoint has to be selected by pressing the POINT button first and then entering the waypoint ident in the KU. After entering the waypoint press the `DEL` button which will display a sub-menu asking the player for a confirmation for deleting the waypoint, `YES` for deleting and `NO` for keeping the waypoint.

### Storing Current Position (STO)

The helicopter has the ability to store the current position of the helicopter as a waypoint via the TSD page. It only has one submenu option, `NOW`, which will upon pressing will store the current position of the helicopter as a waypoint.

### Creating a RTE(RTE)

This will allow the player to create a proper flightplan following a set of waypoints imported and/or created by the player. The RTE sub-page is accessed via the `RTE` button at the bottom of the TSD page.

It will display the following operations, ADD, DEL, DIR and RVM on the left side and END on the right side.

To add a waypoint to the route, press `ADD`, press `POINT` to enter the waypoint IDENT from the KU and then press END to add the waypoint to the route. All waypoints added to route are added serially, basically one after the other.

To delete a waypoint from the route, press `DEL` and select the waypoint from the route. This will delete the waypoint without any _confirmation message_. 

`DIR` works similar to ADD, the player can either choose a waypoint from the RTE list or enter a waypoint `IDENT` using the U after pressing `POINT`.

### Importing waypoints

To import waypoints, follow the guide present under the [DTU](/mpd-dms) page. 

## Adding Target Points (THRT)

This is similar to adding a normal waypoint in the NAV mode. This can be done from either mode. 

1. Click on `THRT` to bring up the submenu for adding, deleting, editing or storing a target point. This sub-menu is the same as the waypoint sub-menu for the NAV mode. The only difference is that the player is entering targets into the ATK database for the helicopter rather than waypoints, hazard points or control measures.
2. The possible IDENTs for the waypoints can be found [here](.mpd-dms).
3. The FREE text box, as above only takes 3 characters should be used to describe the type of threat. For example a `SA-6` site can be represented as a `SA6`. Advised not to leave blank.

## ABR
This is a sub page of the TSD page which can be accessed from the ABR button. This sub page lists all the possible identifications for a waypoint or control measure or target point along with an explanation for each identification. The identifications are also colour coded for differentiating  types of identifications for example, friendly is light blue (cyan) and enemy is red.

<!-- #### Filtering targets

1. Click on the FLTR button (R3) to cycle between all different filter options.

The following options are available for filtering targets:

| Filter Name | Icon | Description |
| :- | :-: | :- |
| All | ![](images/tex/mpd/ALL.png) | No filter is applied
| Tracked vehicles | ![](images/tex/mpd/TRacK.png) | Only vehicles with tracks are displayed 
| Radiation sources | ![](images/tex/mpd/RADiation.png) | Radiation sources (radar sites)
| Wheel | ![](images/tex/mpd/WHeeL.png) | Wheeled vehicles
| PFZs 1-8 | ![](images/tex/char/G1_ca.png) .. ![](images/tex/char/G8_ca.png) | Only targets in this PFZ will be shown. | -->
