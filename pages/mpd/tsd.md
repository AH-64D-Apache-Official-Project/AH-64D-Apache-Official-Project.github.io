## Introduction

The TSD, or tactical situation display, is one of the pages you will find yourself heavily using. It is where any waypoints, control measures and target points made or imported via the logic entities will be displayed, along with where all your targeting information generated by the FCR is stored.

It can be in one of two modes, either ATK or NAV. In ATK, it is going to show you targeting information while in NAV it is going to show you waypoints.

{% include important.html content="In reality in the real aircraft the distinction between the two modes is less defined, you can see most things in both situations. The information displayed can be changed via the SHOW push button." %}

There are the following limitations for the control measures, waypoints and target points : 
1. 49 Control Measures
2. 50 Waypoints
3. 50 Target Points

{% include important.html content="In NAV mode/phase the top 16 targets are shown. In the ATK mode/phase 128 FCR targets can be displayed." %}
