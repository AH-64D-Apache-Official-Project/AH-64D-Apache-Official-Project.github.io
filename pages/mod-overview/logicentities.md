This section will explain the new logic entities provided by the Apache mod and how they can be used exclusively with the helicopter for gameplay. The mission maker has access to them and should be used for a proper gameplay experince for the players.

### Waypoint

This logic entity provides waypoints which the helicotper can use. There are different types of waypoints which can be specified through the logic menu.

### Control Points

### Target Points

This is to create points where known targets are. If the mission maker wants to specify an area of interest, they should use the control points instead.
